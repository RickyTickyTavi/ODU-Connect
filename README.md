# Front End 

Authors: Richard Burleson(Project Lead), Jay Speidell(API and front-end), Rob Wagoner(DB), Caitlyn Quinn(front end)

This is the front end application for ODU Connect. It communicates with the back end database via a REST API. 

Commits to this repository are automatically compiled and deployed to our CS Department server alongside the project website.

As long as the university still hosts the DB, this application will run as intended.
